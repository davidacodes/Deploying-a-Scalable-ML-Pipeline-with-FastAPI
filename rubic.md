# Deploying a Machine Learning Model with FastAPI Project Rubric


## Git

- Set up git with GitHub Actions.
	
    - GitHub action should run pytest and flake8 on push to main/master.
    - PyTest must pass (by time the project is done there should be at least three tests) and flake8 must pass without errors.
    - Include a screenshot of the CI passing called continuous_integration.png.


## Model Building

- Create a machine learning model.
	
    - The model should train on the provided data. The data should either be split to have a train-test split or use cross-validation on the entire dataset.
    - Implement all stubbed functions in the starter code `ml/model.py` or create equivalents. At a minimum, there should be functions to:
        - train, save and load the model and any categorical encoders
        - model inference
        - determine the classification metrics.
    - Complete the script in `train_model.py` that takes in the data, processes it, trains the model, and saves it and the encoder. This script must use the functions you have written.

- Write unit tests.
	
    - Write at least 3 unit tests on ML or the data.
    - Include a screenshot showing all tests passed. Name it unit_test.png.

- Write a function that computes model metrics on slices of the data.
	
    Complete a function `performance_on_categorical_slice` in `ml/model.py` that computes performance on model slices.
    Complet the `train_model.py` script that runs the `performance_on_categorical_slice` function that iterates through the distinct values in one of the features and prints out the model metrics for each value.
    Output the printout to a file named `slice_output.txt`.

- Write a model card.
	
    - The model card should address every section of the template.
    - The model card should be written in complete sentences and include metrics on model performance. Please include both the metrics used and your model's performance on those metrics.


## API Creation

- Create a REST API.
	
    - In `main.py` The API must implement GET and POST. GET must be on the root domain and give a greeting, and POST on a different path that does model inference.

- API interaction
	
    - The `local_api.py` has both GET and POST requests
    - The API is tested locally by running the `local_api.py`
    - A screenshot `local_api.png` showing the successful status code and the corresponding messages and results in the terminal.
